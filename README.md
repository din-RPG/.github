# dinoRPG
DinoRPG  is a free MMORPG  where the player  will have  to evolve his  dinoz  by
exploring a vast and unique world.

## Context
On March 27th 2020,  [Motion-Twin][1]  published a  [message][2] on its platform
[Twinoid][3]  about  the end of  Flash by the  end of 2020. Their  games will be
gradually closed based on how the player-base dwindles.   
On August 9th 2022,  [Motion-Twin][1]  published  under  the "[Attribution - Non
Commercial - Share  Alike 4.0 International][4]"  license a part of the  [source
code and assets][5] [[archive][6]].

Faced with  the situation, I ([Angelisium][7]) decided to start  backup projects
for each of the different games : [soon (a global summary page)][7].
